The To-do App is a web Application designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In 
this App we can add our daily activities and using JavaScript and there are buttons to 
mark the task as completed and it will strike-off the task that is competed and we can 
delete the tasks when we donâ€™t need them further. 
This app is designed with very cool CSS animations, the buttons and the input fields 
show animations when we hover over the objects. 
This project is based on the DOM manipulation, Using event Listeners, this will 
provide the functionality of adding new child elements to the web page and deleting 
them using the buttons.
